You have completed the task excellent. I like it very much, with the data attributes that you have placed. 
You could also do it with ID, because usually you have IDs coming from the database and you can use them for free.
This is just a suggestion it is not a demand, again great work!

One small remark though.
Please don't place any constants into the constructor, this is antipattern.
If you need to have multiple values, use them directly into the state.
If you still need some variables to allocate memory, place them inside render() method, this is the desired pattern.
